So, I'm setting this first blog and post using vim. Let me tell you the story... 

After having a not-so-splendid experience using atom - probably, due to my own inability to keep it from stalling or crashing every other day - I made the decision to fully engage in learning vim a week ago.  I was told the learning curve would be pretty steep, and that it would take me approximately two weeks to be as productive, or near-productive as I was with my previous editor.

This is what I found: 
	That learning vim from scratch, takes a couple of days, if you go all in. That is, decide to disable the arrow keys, as you are told to do by most everyone, and invest in spending your required thirty minutes on vimtutor, at least three times. And one more thing, to stay out of the insert mode, unless I was actually inputting things onto the page. This last part was the harder bargain to keep.  
        Apart from learning the modal settings, and issues of productiveness, what took me longer, was getting my config folder set up so that vim would be usable at all.  Without anyone helping, it took me approximately, three days to read a bunch of stackoverflow, blog posts, and vimcasts, to understand how to set up the config file to customize it to my needs.  As in the tradition of everyone who uses vim as their full-text editor, I now have a dotfile, with every bit of it borrowed from someone else's dotfile.  This, I learned, is the tradition of all the vim users, unless you are Tim Pope, who's written half of the plugins that I now have in my dotfile. 

Here's my experience: 
  Vim is quite the fun! Apart from fun, I feel more engaged with my code when I type in vim. 
  Unfortunately, it gives me a false sense that I am a good coder, like Josh Cheek, my ruby hero, though I'm not.  It's a cheap way to buy confidence, but feeling a wee bit like your ruby hero feels fun! So I don't mind it for now! Yeah, I'm an impostor!

Here's my advice: 
  Start with vimtutor. 
  Yes, tough love!, but don't use the arrow keys to navigate. 
  Be patient. 
  Set up your own dotfile, rather than wholesale copy paste someone elses.  Trust me!, it was three tough days in the wilderness, but the payoff for me was great because I now know what everything in my dotfile does, and know how to adjust accordingly.  
  As for the above advice, ask someone to help you with it, but don't let them takeover your dotfile, do it yourself. 

  Get in touch, if you want help with setting your dotfile.
