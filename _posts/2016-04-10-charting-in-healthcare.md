title: "charting in healthcare: musings from a former nurse "

I had been a nurse close to 10 years before I decided to make a switch to learning code.  Having gained some competency 
learning Ruby in the first six weeks at a code school (with another 18 weeks left to go), I'm certain I made the right 
choice in leaving nursing.  In doing so, I'm hoping to help the nursing profession, and the general medical system, to be
more efficient, more error proof, and to be able to spend valuable time doing things that improve outcome of patients, rather than
simply continue the status quo of most healthcare systems of practicing defensive healthcare. 

There's a lot of market money to be had within healthcare.  One of the areas where a lot of money is spent is in the way that 
doctors, nurses and other healthcare professional chart their assessments, view daily labs and images, and communicate in notes
to the oncoming shift. Both the software, training, and then the maintenance that goes on to do this, is rather enormous.  
I had been working as a nurse in a Washington D.C. hospital for approximately three years, when the switch to a newer, and promisingly
better, medical software came on.  The word around the medical campus was that the hospital admin had paid ten million dollars for 
this system. Massive training went on to get everyone on board to make the transition fetter free.  On day one, after the 
software went live, it was obvious that the system was flawed moving window after window.  As an example, one of the 
patients I had admitted, lacked a radial pulse, and in addition, had an elevated heart beat in the 140s, but otherwise, he 
appeared asymptomatic.  I called the doctor to notify of the observations, and followed this by logging into the system to 
chart my observations.  It was immediately obvious that there were no text fields to explain the abnormals.  The page was
full of boxes to click on instead.  I suppose the idea behind this design was that clicking took less time than manually inputing
a field. And while I appreciated the efforts of those who had designed this, I couldn't understand what led someone or a group
of people to choose this path in their design.  Were nurses consulted? Were edge cases, as this was for this particular patient's 
cardiovascular system considered?  Was a nursing flow imagined and tried out when this design was decided?  With no where to 
write the abnormals, I went back to the ancient art of inking the paper wet on the patients chart.  This was worth ten million
dollars.  After hordes of other complaints arose within the first week, the hospital was said to have received a seven million discount
for the faux pas from the software company. 

In my ten years, I have charted on five different software systems, and unfortunately, my work as an efficient nurse was only
edged out ever so minorly by the software.  I found most of the irksome, and it would be no short of a lie to say that the 
thing I hated the most in my day was charting.  I can't imagine charting would ever be a pleasant experience.  But let's imagine
that we it would be possible that charting could have something like a happiness quotient, like ruby has been for programmers. 
I would imagine that if the starting point of a charting software system begins with that in mind, as it was for Matz when he created
Ruby, I think the step towards building a more efficient, and error-proof charting software in healthcare would be a lot closer, and no
less hailed by thousands of professionals that currently succumb to less than excellent healthcare products.
